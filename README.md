# Python-Pudding
This is just a repo with all the libraries I'm trying to make inside of python (like a compilation) instead of uploading them as a repo one by one.
I picked pudding name because it started with letter 'P' and also because of pudding is delicious.

# List of Pudding Libraries
- [x] Vector
- [ ] Text Preprocessing
- [ ] Linear Algebra
- [ ] Discrete Mathematics
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] Tiny Machine Learning
- [ ] Tiny Deep Learning
